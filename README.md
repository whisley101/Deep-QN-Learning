# Deep-QN-Learning
DQN agent training in the Gym lunar lander environment

To run, execute each Jupyter cell in order. The 5th cell executes the DQN process. The settings are currently set to the current replay size, batch sample size and discount factor. 
The score history throughout the 1000 training episodes is captured as well as the time it takes to train the agent
Cell 6 takes the trained agent and runs through the 100 consecutive episode test.
The rest of the cells are for plotting the results.
